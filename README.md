# Responsive Portfolio

Project: The project was the create a personal website as both a location for future employers to look at but also to create responsive pages.

This repository is the transformation of my old portfolio from simple html and css to react. As the bootcamp is coming full circle we have now learnt easier and more efficient ways to go about web development. I hope to keep building on this website till it's in the best position to actually show future employers. 

UI
I took this time to focus on getting a colour scheme for the website seeing as I didn't have one before. I also created three pages and used Routers to get access to each one. My components were minimal with the bio and the project cards requiring the most break down.
